1. We have successfully implemented "gen" mode and gotten it to output a 32 bit int to a txt file for dieharder to read. Still need to figure out seperating the ints when multiple trials are run.
2. Started work on histogram output for "stat" mode.
3. Installed dieharder, have yet to test .txt file for correct output from dieharder.
